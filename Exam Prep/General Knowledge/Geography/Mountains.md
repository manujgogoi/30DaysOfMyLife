# Mountains & Volcanos

## Mountain Types:

There are many types of mountains, including:

1. **Volcanic Mountains**

- Mount Fuji (Japan) - 3,776 meters (12,389 feet)
- Mauna Loa (Hawaii, USA) - 4,169 meters (13,678 feet) above sea level, but about 9,170 meters (30,085 feet) from the base on the ocean floor
- Mount St. Helens (Washington, USA) - 2,550 meters (8,366 feet)
- Mount Vesuvius (Italy) - 1,281 meters (4,203 feet)

2. **Upwarped Mountains**
   These mountains form when the Earth's crust is pushed up by forces originating beneath it, usually due to the movement of tectonic plates.

- Black Hills (South Dakota, USA) - Harney Peak (now Black Elk Peak), the highest point, is 2,208 meters (7,244 feet)
- Adirondack Mountains (New York, USA) - Mount Marcy, the highest peak, is 1,629 meters (5,344 feet)

3. **Fault-Block Mountains**
   These mountains are formed by the movement of large crustal blocks when forces in the Earth's crust pull it apart.

- Sierra Nevada (California/Nevada, USA) - Mount Whitney, the highest peak, is 4,421 meters (14,505 feet)
- Tetons (Wyoming, USA) - Grand Teton, the highest peak, is 4,199 meters (13,775 feet)
  Harz Mountains (Germany) - Brocken, the highest peak, is 1,141 meters (3,743 feet)

4. **Folded (Complex) Mountains**
   These mountains form when two tectonic plates collide, causing the Earth's crust to fold.

- Himalayas (Asia) - Mount Everest, the highest peak, is 8,848 meters (29,029 feet)
- Alps (Europe) - Mont Blanc, the highest peak, is 4,808 meters (15,774 feet)
- Rocky Mountains (North America) - Mount Elbert, the highest peak, is 4,401 meters (14,440 feet)

5. **Plateau Mountains**
   Plateau mountains are formed by erosion that cuts into a plateau or by the uplifting of flat-topped areas.

- Colorado Plateau (USA) - Grand Mesa, the largest flat-topped mountain, reaches about 3,404 meters (11,168 feet)
- Tibetan Plateau (Asia) - "The Roof of the World," with an average elevation of around 4,500 meters (14,800 feet), but it includes surrounding peaks like Mount Everest.

6. **Dome Mountains**
   Dome mountains form when molten rock pushes up beneath the crust but does not break through the surface, creating a rounded, dome-like shape.

- Black Hills (South Dakota, USA) - Harney Peak (now Black Elk Peak) is also an example of an upwarped mountain, with a height of 2,208 meters (7,244 feet)
- Navajo Mountain (Utah, USA) - 3,148 meters (10,388 feet)

## Facts

1. World's oldest folded mountain range is Aravali.

- A fold mountain is a mountain that forms when two or more tectonic plates in the Earth's crust are pushed together. The process of folding the Earth's crust to create fold mountains is called **orogeny**, and it takes millions of years.

- Fold mountains are the most common type of mountain in the world. The Himalayas, Andes, and Alps are all active fold mountains.

- The Himalayas stretch through the borders of China, Bhutan, Nepal, India, and Pakistan.
- The Andes are the worldâ€™s longest mountain chain. They stretch along the entire west coast of South America, from Colombia in the north and through Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina to the south.

2. The largest active volcano in the world is Mauna Loa in Hawaii. which is the largest volcano by volume and area covered:

- Height: Mauna Loa rises 4,169 meters above sea level.
- Submarine flanks: Mauna Loa's flanks extend 5 kilometers below the ocean's surface.
- Summit to base: Mauna Loa's summit is about 17 kilometers above its base.
- Lava eruptions: Mauna Loa's lava eruptions are silica-poor and very fluid.

3. The only volcano larger than Mauna Loa is the Tamu Massif, which is located underwater and is now extinct.

### Famous Volcanic Mountains

- Mount Etna (Italy) - One of the most active and famous volcanoes in the world.
- Mount Kilimanjaro (Tanzania) - The highest peak in Africa, made up of three volcanic cones.
- Mount St. Helens (USA) - Known for its catastrophic eruption in 1980.
- Mount Fuji (Japan) - A symbol of Japan, known for its near-perfect conical shape.

4. The Himalayas and Karakoram ranges are the highest mountain ranges in the world.
